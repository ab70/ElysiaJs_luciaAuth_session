# ElysiaJs_luciaAuth_session
Its been a tough choice for early testing of elysiaJs which is in a developing process but it is so promising that i could not hold myself from testing it.
After successfully testing it with some challanges I can say it will be a good choice in future for performance and safety.

Used:
1.Elysis Js
2.lucia-auth

ElysiaJs still dont have the session management package, so tried to solve it with lucia-suth and did it successfully. And amazed how lucia-auth works with 3 different table for handling user, session and a key table.
